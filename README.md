## Welcome to my GitHub page
Here I keep some of my R projects, all of which are more or less related to my work on intra-state conflict. It's also where you can find the development versions of the CRAN packages [acled.api](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=acled.api) and [disastr.api](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=disastr.api). In case of any questions or issues with the code, please do not hesitate to get in touch. For more information on my research, please visit [my website](https://www.chrisdworschak.com/).
