## Welcome to my GitHub page (moved)

Important notice: all projects are moved to GitLab @[https://gitlab.com/chris-dworschak/](https://gitlab.com/chris-dworschak/), including the development versions of the CRAN packages [acled.api](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=acled.api) and [disastr.api](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=disastr.api). 

Versions here are kept for existing dependencies, but will not receive updates anymore. In case of any issues with the code, please switch pulls to my GitLab profile for latest releases.
