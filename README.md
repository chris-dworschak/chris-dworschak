## Welcome to my GitHub page (MOVED)

Hi there. I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and a fellow at the Michael Nicholson Centre for Conflict and Cooperation, University of Essex. For more information on my research have a look at [my website](https://www.chrisdworschak.com/).

Note: in favour of the open-source license, I moved all projects over to GitLab @[https://gitlab.com/chris-dworschak/](https://gitlab.com/chris-dworschak/), including the development versions of the CRAN packages [acled.api](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=acled.api) and [disastr.api](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=disastr.api). GitHub only contains mirrors of the original GitLab repositories. This is a one-way pipeline, so merge requests on GitHub are not accepted. In case of questions do not hesitate to get in touch.
